**Robotics Studio Project and Reinforcement Learning Implementation**

- Designed a bipedal robot, including *3D* printing of components. Successfully integrated six *LX-16A servo motors*, a *DC-to-DC converter*, a motor controller, and a *Raspberry Pi 4* to complete the robot's drive system.
- Developed and implemented a walking program, achieving a robot walking speed of 4.2 cm/s.
- Created the robot's *URDF (Unified Robot Description Format*) file to accurately model its physical properties. Simulated the robot in *NVIDIA Isaac Sim* for verification and testing.
- Trained the robot to walk on flat terrain using the *Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO*) algorithm in *Isaac Lab*. Input data included *IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)* and six joint position sensors. The robot achieved a walking speed of 20.1 cm/s on flat surfaces.
-  Integrated a ground-height sensor (*RayCaster*) for the robot and extended training to uneven terrain with varying heights ranging from 0 cm to 4 cm. Enabled the robot to maintain a stable walking speed of 19.9 cm/s, demonstrating robust adaptability to environmental variations.
- *Future Work:* Apply the reinforcement learning training results to the physical robot to validate and refine the performance in real-world scenarios.
