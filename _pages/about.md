[**Design of Hydraulic System of Single-leg Structure of Multi-legged Robot*](https://youtu.be/Mp3_kLw8cQc)
------
  
- Designed a hydraulic manifold block in a 200*200 board in SolidWorks, and applied software to simulate the pressure of liquid flow to improve the block property with the consideration of other factors such as price.
- According to the maximum load and speed of different parts’ cylinders, calculated appropriate cylinder diameter, maximum tolerable pressure, and flow rate.
- Carried out a comprehensive literature review on the selection of board materials in terms of factors such as liquid pressure, flow speed, and price, and found out which material best suits the cylinder parameters above.
- Used SolidWorks to simulate the pipeline structure with 5 valve blocks mounted on the board, drew the valve and assembly diagrams, and eventually ordered the prototypes of suitable valves online to complete assembly.

[**Robotics Senior Design at the University of Detroit Mercy**](https://youtu.be/Mp3_kLw8cQc)
------
- Designed an assistant robot system to help elderly individuals, combining mobile robots, computer vision, and a robotic manipulator.
- Modeled the *ReactorX-200* robotic arm and developed an app in *Matlab* to simulate both forward and inverse kinematics of the robotic arm. Finally, applied the algorithm to the real robotic arm for verification and used the program to control the arm.
- Trained dataset using *YOLOv8* and combined it with *Kinect V2* point cloud data to achieve target object localization.
- Performed camera calibration and hand-eye calibration between the robotic arm and the camera, significantly improving the grasping accuracy.
- Implemented navigation functionality using the *A\** algorithm for global path planning and the *DWA* algorithm for local path planning.

**RoboCup China Open 2022 ROBOCUP@HOME**
------
- Designed home service robot with capabilities in guest reception and guidance, object grasping & delivery, object recognition, and voice interaction.

- Designed and executed a algorithm combining object recognition with object grasping and delivery.

-	Orchestrated a four-step approach, including precise identification of target objects, accurate localization using depth cameras, pose analysis for gripping, and precise control of the robotic arm for successful object grasping and delivery.

-	Utilized *MoveIt* with *Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL)* for motion and path planning, *RRT\** algorithm for efficient trajectory generation, and *TRAC-IK* for accurate inverse kinematics.

-	Integrated *YOLOv5* and *Kinect DK* to achieve target object recognition and 3D localization.

- Used the *Grasp Pose Detection (GPD)* package to detect 6-DOF grasp poses for a 2-finger robot hand in 3D point clouds, enabling the grasping of objects in various orientations.

-	Successfully developed and implemented a unique robotic door-opening solution to complete the challenging task – the only team that completed this task.

-	Innovatively combined precise base positioning and mechanical arm path planning, significantly reducing computation time, streamlining the process, and efficiently completing door-opening tasks while ensuring obstacle avoidance.

💻 Internships
======
Beijing Tinavi Medical Technologies Co., Ltd., Beijing	05/2023—08/2023  
Participated in a project called PKP (Percutaneous Kyphoplasty) from Party A of the company, cooperated with colleagues to design a system using the computer to control the robotic arm to push a syringe to inject bone cement and contrast media, and my job was to design the injector model and assemble its prototype.
Based on the previous patented syringe model, designed quick pressure relief device to exhaust the gas in the syringe, and devised quick disassembly device to ensure that the doctor could remove the injector immediately and finish the injection manually once the machine failed.
Completed the syringe model design and simulation in CREO 3.0 and AutoCAD software, derived the most suitable parameters through gradual adjustment and simulation, used a laser 3D printer to generate the 3D model, and eventually purchased auxiliary accessories from the supplier to accomplish the injector assembling. 
The syringe was the first one on the market that could be equipped with quick disassembly and pressure relief devices simultaneously to inject bone cement and contrast media so it was granted a patent.
